## Webhooks

When an event occurs in the service, it triggers a webhook. The service then sends the event details to your chosen URL, ensuring your system receives real-time updates. Your app can immediately respond to event types such as order updates, subscription changes, or refunds. This flow keeps your systems in sync with the service. By leveraging webhooks, developers automate workflows, improve user experiences, and keep data up to date across platforms without inefficient polling.

The service notifies your endpoint URL of Admin API events via webhooks, each carrying the event type and timestamp. Manage all webhooks through the Admin API's Webhooks Service.
