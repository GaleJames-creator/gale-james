## About Me

I’m a Senior Technical Writer with 9+ years of experience creating documentation that developers actually want to use. I specialize in API documentation, developer tools, and payment systems, with a track record of leading documentation teams and migrating complex content platforms.

**What I bring:**
- Strategic documentation planning using the Diátaxis framework
- Enterprise API documentation experience (REST, OpenAPI, payment systems)
- Docs-as-code workflows with Git, Markdown, and modern platforms
- Team leadership and documentation standards development
- AI-assisted technical writing workflows

**Currently seeking:** Senior/Lead Technical Writer roles focused on developer-facing products, API documentation, or developer tools.

## 📂 Portfolio Projects

### 🌟 Featured: BookHub Publisher API Documentation
**[View Project →](./book-api-docs/)**

Production-ready API documentation suite demonstrating enterprise technical writing and strategic decision-making.

**Highlights:**
- Complete API integration guide with multi-language examples (Python, JavaScript, Java, PHP)
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification for automated client generation
- Enterprise release management documentation
- Strategic versioning decision with documented rationale
- Systematic QA: resolved 258 encoding issues for cross-platform compatibility

**Skills demonstrated:** API documentation, OpenAPI 3.0, release management, strategic thinking, quality assurance.

**Why this matters:** Shows I can make independent technical decisions, not just follow instructions. I chose path-based API versioning over the course-recommended header-based approach and documented why—demonstrating the strategic thinking senior roles require.

### 📐 Documentation Philosophy: Diátaxis Framework

My portfolio follows the **[Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/)**, which organizes documentation into four user-focused types:

| Type | Purpose | User Goal |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 📚 **[Tutorials](./tutorials/README.md)** | Learning-oriented | "Teach me the basics" |
| 🛠️ **[How-to guides](./how-to-guides/README.md)** | Task-oriented | "Help me solve this problem" |
| 💡 **[Explanation](./explanation/README.md)** | Understanding-oriented | "Help me understand this concept" |
| 📖 **[Reference](./reference/README.md)** | Information-oriented | "Give me the technical details" |

This approach ensures users can easily find what they need, whether they want to learn, do, understand, or look up information.

**Why this matters:** The Diátaxis framework prevents the common documentation mistake of mixing tutorials with reference material, creating confusion. My work demonstrates how to apply this framework to real-world API documentation.

## 💼 Professional Experience
