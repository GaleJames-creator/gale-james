# Gale James - Senior/Lead Technical Writer

## About me
With over 15 years of experience, I specialize in developer documentation, API reference, and payment systems. My work helps technical teams excel.

## Documentation philosophy: Diátaxis framework
My portfolio follows the **[Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/)**, which organizes documentation into these four user-focused types:

- **[📚 Tutorials](./tutorials/README.md)**: Learning-oriented, step-by-step lessons
- **[🛠️ How-to guides](./how-to-guides/README.md)**: Task-oriented, problem-solving directions  
- **[💡 Explanation](./explanation/README.md)**: Understanding-oriented, conceptual knowledge
- **[📖 Reference](./reference/README.md)**: Information-oriented, technical specifications

This approach helps users easily find the content they need, whether they want to learn, do, understand, or look up information.

## Documentation experience
