# Gale James - Senior/Lead Technical Writer

## About me
With over 15 years of experience, I specialize in developer documentation, API reference, and payment systems. My work helps technical teams excel.

## Documentation philosophy
My portfolio follows the **Diátaxis framework**, which organizes documentation into these four user-focused types:

- **Tutorials**: Learning-oriented, step-by-step lessons
- **How-to guides**: Task-oriented, problem-solving directions  
- **Explanation**: Understanding-oriented, conceptual knowledge
- **Reference**: Information-oriented, technical specifications

## Writing Approach

I adapt my writing for each content type:

* **Tutorials**: Friendly and step-by-step
* **How-to guides**: Clear and action-oriented
* **Explanations**: Informative and easy to understand
* **Reference**: Concise and factual

## Portfolio organization

This portfolio demonstrates my experience with all four content types and is organized as follows:

- [Explaination](./explanation/README.md)
- [How-to-guides](./how-to-guides/README.md)
- [Reference](./reference/README.md)
- [Tutorials](./tutorials/README.md)
